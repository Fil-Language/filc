# Roadmap

Here it is the planned roadmap for filc development until v1.0.0. As filc is the main brick of Fil, its roadmap also concern some other tools.

## v0.1.0

**Minimal release**

- packaging to rpm, deb, docker and nix at least. If possible technically also package for chocolate and brew.
- Variables + types + operations

## v0.2.0

**Functional release**

- Functions and lambdas
- Loops and conditions
- Modules, export and import

## v0.3.0

**Object release**

- Data structures

## Development of standard library then fmm

To continue working on filc, we must first develop standard library and then fmm.

## v1.0.0-rc1

rc1 to rcN are pre-release version to check everything and use a first full version of the compiler. It's only when a release candidate is stable enough that v1.0.0 is released.
