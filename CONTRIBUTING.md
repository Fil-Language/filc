### Submitting pull requests

Before we can merge your pull request, here are some guidelines you need to follow.

These guidelines help keeping the code clean, stable and easier to review.

**Principles**

- No dead code: If you create a function, it's to use it
- All functions, class, types should be as strictly as possible
- Comment, sometimes it's painful to comment, but it helps you and us to understand the code, improve it, maintain it

**Conventions**

C++ conventions and rules are all listed in `.clang-tidy` and `.clang-format` files. Modern IDEs all supports
formatting from these files. If you not use an IDE, please call `clang-tidy` as often as possible to keep your code
clear.

**Commits**

Please follow [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines for your commit message.
A [template](commit-template) is available, you can use by running `git config commit.template commit-template`.

All your commit *MUST* work. If your feature is too big to be in one commit, add exceptions, early returns to keep the
code working.

**Tests**

We try to keep our test coverage as high as possible. It means that everything *MUST* be tested.

If you submit a bug fix, add a test case reproducing the bug. If it's a new feature, add tests covering all code paths.

Testing code paths is not just the happy path, tests as many case as possible. This software needs to be stable.

**License**

By contributing to filc, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file in the
root directory of this source tree.

Each file *MUST* begin with the license text.

**Pull request**

When submitting your pull request please follow the provided template. Our team will review your code as soon as
possible.
